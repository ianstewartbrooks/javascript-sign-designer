# Javscript Sign Designer

## Description

This javascript application allows the user to use an interactive designer to create a sign for the front of their house or building. The user has various materials, shapes, fonts, colours and background brick textures to choose whilst designing their sign/plaque.

Once they have finished their design the information (materials chosen, etc) is then saved in the system for someone to actually make the sign/plaque and send it to the customer.

I wrote this application using Javascript and JQuery for a job I was doing for an web design agency who supplied me with all the images, etc - it was my first major JS app. They were developing a site/system for a client who wanted to create signs/plaques for their customers from stone and various other materials. My task was to write the base application and then the agency would then make it look 'pretty' and attach it to the rest of the system/backend they were designing.
